# Intelligent crossroad system

This repository contains sources of the ICS (Intelligent Crossroad System) case study. The sources are based on the inhouse developed CDEECo (realtime C based implementation of Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components), and OMNeT++(well estabilished network simulator). Main puropose of this project is to show how ICS maps into DEECo Ensembles and Component with respect to realtime CDEECo implementation. Further the network simulation manifests the feasibility of such system in terms of reliability and timing requirements.
